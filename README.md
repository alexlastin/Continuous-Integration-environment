# Continuous-Integration-environment
Software development organisations often face a problem of slow application delivery. Usually this happens because the software development process is clunky and not very effective. Developers put the software code into random locations, there are issues with integrating the code coming from different developers, build process takes a lot of time and not reliable, and the generated release artefacts are not properly stored, maintained and versioned.

To tackle these problems, organisations use the method of Continuous Integration which is part of a bigger area of Development Operations (DevOps). Continuous Integration approach uses pre-configured infrastructure environments and specific tooling to ensure the smooth delivery of releases. 

Continuous Integration environments are generally very complicated to set up / make sure that its components are working nicely together. 

The goal of this project is to create a software application to automate the provisioning and set up of Continuous Integration environment.
